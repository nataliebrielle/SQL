--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.


--How many orders were placed in January
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--How many of those orders were an iPhone
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE product = 'iPhone' AND length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Select the customer accounts for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS february ON customers.order_id=february.orderID 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price
SELECT product,price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January
SELECT product,SUM(quantity)*price  AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue
SELECT product,SUM(quantity),SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum),AVG(quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers 
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS february ON customers.order_id=february.orderID WHERE february.quantity > 2 AND length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many were sold
SELECT distinct product, SUM(quantity)  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%' GROUP BY product;
